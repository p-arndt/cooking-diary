<p align="center">

</p>

**sentio** _[ˈsen.ti.oː]_ is Latin for "I feel" or "to perceive".

Everyone logs how they feel each day, and Sentio turns those entries into trends, insights, and early signals so teams stay healthy and connected.

Similar to a classic **Niko-Niko calendar**, but modern, visual, and built for real-world teams.

### Nested Teams & Organizational Hierarchy

Sentio supports creating complex organizational structures with nested teams:

- **Container Teams**: Mark teams as "container teams" to group multiple sub-teams without having direct members. Container teams display all their child teams' calendars in a unified view
- **Organization Tree View**: Visual tree structure showing your complete team hierarchy with expandable/collapsible nodes
- **Nested Calendar Display**: When viewing a container team, all child teams are displayed as nested calendars with color-coded borders for easy distinction
- **Settings Inheritance**: Child teams can inherit settings from their parent teams, making it easy to maintain consistent configurations across your organization
- **Hierarchy Navigation**: Easy navigation through the team structure with breadcrumbs and direct links to parent/child teams

Perfect for organizations with departments, sub-teams, or multi-level structures!
